### Hello there and welcome! My name is Goran PopoviÄ‡.

I'm a software developer, with various experience in the industry, currently working as a backend developer in an AI-powered company. 
I started my career within WordPress ecosystem, but for the last couple of years I have really enjoyed working with Laravel. 
When able, I'm sharing some of my knowledge and experiences in the form of blog posts at [geoligard.com](https://geoligard.com). I write mostly about Laravel and other related topics.
